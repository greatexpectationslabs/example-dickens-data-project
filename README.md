# example-dickens-data-project
A toy data project based on the collected works of Charles Dickens.

## Manifest


1. A small dataset on the works of Charles Dickens: `data/notable_works_by_charles_dickens.csv`
2. An exploratory ML model showing that Dickens' titles got longer as his career progressed: `notebooks/explore_and_predict_stuff_about_dickens_novels.ipynb`
3. A raw exported version of the notebook: `pipeline/explore_and_predict_stuff_about_dickens_novels.py`
4. A cleaned up, productionizable version of the notebook: `title_length_prediction_pipeline.py`
